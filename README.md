# Junit Test Report

# Assumptions & Notes
1. Version is an integer and is not auto generated by the system. The application checks if the user provides a latest version or the version last inserted. 
2. The system will not update the older version of the record, except for the record with the latest version.
3. The system will not allow to delete any records. 
4. A job runs every day at 12pm to update the expried flag based on if the maturity date is less than current date.
5. Only Json format is allowed to fetch the record or insert/update the records.
6. All the dates are shown in IST and dd/MM/YYYY format.
7. A self-signed certificate is being used for secured http connection. The service endpoints use https and port 8443 port.
8. A h2 database has been used for storing the trade store records. It is in memory database, rebooting of the application will clean the previously inserted records.
9. Maven build tool has been used to build the application.
10. Junits covers all the insert and update scenarios. The developement was not done with TDD.
11. AOP has been used to intercept and to log the time taken by each method.
12. Loggers (logback) has been used in this program. Both Console and File loggings are enabled.

# Next Steps:
1. Create a Docker Image and plug into a CI/CD pipeline
2. oAuth can be implemented for authorizing/authenticating the users that call the rest services
3. Junits can be implemented to cover the scenarios integrating a temporary database.(e.g for testing JPA interface methods)
